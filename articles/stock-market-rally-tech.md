# Stock markets rally as tech sector leads gains

Global stock markets surged on Thursday, driven largely by the technology sector after several major firms posted better-than-expected earnings.  

## Market Performance

- **Sensex & Nifty**: Both indexes closed up by over 2%, led by gains in IT and banking.  
- **US Tech Giants**: Nasdaq hit a 12-month high as Apple and Microsoft reported record revenues.  
- **European Markets**: FTSE and DAX followed the upward trend, signaling global investor optimism.  

## Investor Sentiment

Analysts highlighted that strong consumer demand for AI-driven products and digital services has fueled the latest rally.  

Market strategist Karan Malhotra stated:  
*"Investors are increasingly looking at tech as a safe bet in uncertain times. The sector's resilience continues to outshine expectations."*

## Key Drivers

- Surge in **AI and cloud computing adoption**  
- **Banking sector stability** after recent regulatory measures  
- Improved **foreign investment inflows** into emerging markets  

## Risks Ahead

Despite the rally, experts warned of potential volatility if global inflation persists or central banks signal unexpected rate hikes.  

## Outlook

- **Short term**: Positive momentum likely to continue into next week's trading.  
- **Long term**: Investors are advised to diversify portfolios as market corrections remain possible.  

The upbeat mood has sparked hopes of a sustained bull run, though caution remains the watchword for risk-averse players.
